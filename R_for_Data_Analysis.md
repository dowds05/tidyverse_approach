## What is R?
<https://r-project.org>

"R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics."
R is open source, and its flexible and expandable nature has led to over 15,000 R packages being written to accomplish almost every task in data analytics imaginable, frequently in multiple ways.

The large user base has also generated tons of guides, online tutorials, and help to specific topics (and bugs).  The possibilities are endless, if sometimes chaotic.

## Why R?
<https://www.win-vector.com/blog/2019/08/why-r>

"In our opinion the R ecosystem is the fastest path to substantial data science, statistical, and machine learning accomplishment."
[Practical Data Science with R, by Zumel, Mount, and Manning]

Due to its open nature, R is constantly developing and expanding in capability.  Also, because it is freely available to anyone worldwide for any use, projects in R can be assured of an audience and the potential for use and collaboration is unrestricted.

## What is RStudio?
<https://rstudio.com>

Rstudio is the leading company in the R space, contributing to many packages and tools that have become de facto standards.  They also produce the Rstudio Desktop and Server development environments, as well as Shiny.

## Why RStudio?

Rstudio has in some ways tamed the chaos of the R landscape, although there are tradeoffs involved.  The RStudio development environment is clear, powerful, easy-to-use, and a fast and effective way to get productive in R.  It is also standardized across all platforms (Linux, Server, Mac, Windows).

## What is the tidyverse?
<https://www.tidyverse.org>

"The tidyverse is an **opinionated** collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures."

## Why the tidyverse?

Some of the tidyverse packages, such as ggplot2 and dplyr, are clear leaders in their domains for power and elegance, while others are on their way there.  Since tidyverse packages are very popular and are designed to work together, they form a good introduction to programming in R.  

However, they are "opinionated" in the sense that their conventions may differ from many long-standing "classic" R packages.  Users should be aware that there is also a whole universe of non-tidyverse approaches to choose from.

## What about those packages?

You can discover packages by searching on [Crantastic](https://crantastic.org) or read about curated collections of important packages on [CRAN Task Views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/).
